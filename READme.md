# üìç Personal Web Page ‚Äì ƒ∞rem Ekinci

[cite_start]This is a personal website created as part of the **GMT 458 Web GIS course assignment**[cite: 2]. [cite_start]The website was designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and OpenLayers (OL) for interactive map functionalities[cite: 5].

## 1. Project Features & Assignment Compliance

[cite_start]The project exceeds the minimum requirements for the assignment[cite: 18].

| Requirement / Feature | Status | Description | Max. Grade Weight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HTML File Structure** | ‚úÖ Compliant | [cite_start]Comprised of at least three different HTML files (Home, Education, Hobbies, Contact)[cite: 13]. | [cite_start]**15%** [cite: 13] |
| **CSS Animation** | ‚úÖ Implemented | [cite_start]Navigation hover effects and **Sequential Fade-in Animation** on all content cards[cite: 15]. | [cite_start]**15%** [cite: 15] |
| **Tabular Info w/ Images** | ‚úÖ Implemented | [cite_start]Education section uses a modern, image-supported card layout[cite: 16]. | [cite_start]**15%** [cite: 16] |
| **OpenLayers (OL) Integration** | ‚úÖ Advanced | [cite_start]Three interactive maps with custom controls[cite: 17]. | [cite_start]**20%** [cite: 17] |
| **Git Usage** | ‚úÖ Compliant | [cite_start]Regular use of Git with commits on different days[cite: 17]. | [cite_start]**10%** [cite: 17] |
| **Overall Quality & UX** | ‚úÖ Excellent | [cite_start]Includes Dark Mode, Responsive Design, and professional icons[cite: 18]. | [cite_start]**25%** [cite: 18] |

## 2. Interactive GIS Functionalities

| Function | OpenLayers Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Base Map Switching** | Button to toggle between OSM and **ArcGIS World Imagery (Satellite)** layers on the fly. |
| **Visited Cities Map** | Custom pin markers that **zoom with smooth animation** and display city name via **Popup Overlay** upon click. |
| **Coordinate Display** | Custom Mouse Position Control showing live **Longitude/Latitude** readings below the maps. |
| **General UX** | Implemented **Scale Line** control for map professionalism. |

## 3. AI Assistance and Learned Skills üß†

[cite_start]I first understood and searched the issues/problems on Google[cite: 19]. [cite_start]I then used AI for guidance on complex implementations[cite: 19].

| Topic | AI Usage Purpose & Key Learning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Layer Management** | Debugging and structuring the JavaScript to handle multiple, non-conflicting map layers (cloning vs. recreating layers). |
| **Theme & UX** | Implementing base map switching (OSM / Satellite) and setting up Dark/Light mode with local storage memory. |
| **Advanced Animations** | Designing smooth scrolling and section fade-in animations. |
| **CSS Debugging** | [cite_start]Optimizing CSS layout, solving responsive design issues, and overriding OpenLayers' default absolute positioning styles for clean coordinate display[cite: 20]. |

[cite_start]**Approximate AI Assistance Time:** **2-3 hours total.** [cite: 21]
