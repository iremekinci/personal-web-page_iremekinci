## AI Assistance and Key Learnings üß†

[cite_start]I first understood and searched the issues/problems on Google, and if I could not resolve it, then I used AI[cite: 19].

| Topic | AI Usage Purpose & Key Learning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Layer Management** | Debugging and structuring the JavaScript to handle multiple map layers without conflicts (cloning vs. recreating layers). |
| **Advanced Animations** | Designing smooth scrolling and section fade-in animations. |
| **Theme Implementation** | Setting up Dark/Light mode with local storage memory. |
| **CSS Overrides** | Overriding OpenLayers' default absolute positioning styles for clean coordinate display. |

**Approximate AI Assistance Time:** **2-3 hours total.**
